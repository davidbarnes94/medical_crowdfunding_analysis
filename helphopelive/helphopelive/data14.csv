"," of $300,000 Goal","San Clemente, CA",(7),"On February 29th, 2016 Chelsea was involved in an ATV accident where she suffered a devastating spinal cord injury. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Desert Regional Hospital in Palm Springs, CA. The MRI diagnosed acute traumatic fracture to the cervical 5 vertebrae. Chelsea is paralyzed from her chest down. Chelsea’s stabilization from pneumonia and multiple infections was managed by Dr. Ercoli and his amazing ICU trauma team at Desert Regional. Chelsea was finally cleared to undergo two separate surgeries. Neurology surgeon, Dr. Berman, stabilized Chelsea’s neck, relieved the spinal cord pressure, replaced C5 with a mesh implant and then fused C4-C6. Chelsea is still battling her respiratory function and nutritional needs.  She is now stable and ready to be moved to a rehabilitation facility.  We are sending her to the most highly-regarded spinal cord rehabilitation facility in the country, Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado. Before this tragic accident, she was blossoming into an amazing woman.  She had really just started her grown up life. She had many extraordinary talents.  She would sketch and create beautiful images and is known for her stunning jewelry creations. Chelsea graduated from Toni & Guy Hair Academy in 2013. She has been using her creative skills in hairdressing and as a make-up artist.  Chelsea’s heart and loving spirit is cherished by everyone who knows her.  Her grace is shared with all who come into contact with her.  She has stunning beauty inside and out! Chelsea has successfully delivered her baby Wyatt.  She was 3 months pregnant at the time of her accident. This little warrior has made it through her surgeries and a very difficult pregnancy. We are blessed to have him arrive at 38 weeks and healthy! Chelsea is facing a very difficult future for a young 24-year-old woman. Disabled and a new single mom!
