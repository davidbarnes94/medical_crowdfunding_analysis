"$192,131","Chelsea Needs Your Help With Injury-Related Expenses
"," of $300,000 Goal","San Clemente, CA",(7),"On February 29th, 2016 Chelsea was involved in an ATV accident where she suffered a devastating spinal cord injury. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Desert Regional Hospital in Palm Springs, CA. The MRI diagnosed acute traumatic fracture to the cervical 5 vertebrae. Chelsea is paralyzed from her chest down. Chelseaâ€™s stabilization from pneumonia and multiple infections was managed by Dr. Ercoli and his amazing ICU trauma team at Desert Regional. Chelsea was finally cleared to undergo two separate surgeries. Neurology surgeon, Dr. Berman, stabilized Chelseaâ€™s neck, relieved the spinal cord pressure, replaced C5 with a mesh implant and then fused C4-C6. Chelsea is still battling her respiratory function and nutritional needs.  She is now stable and ready to be moved to a rehabilitation facility.  We are sending her to the most highly-regarded spinal cord rehabilitation facility in the country, Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado. Before this tragic accident, she was blossoming into an amazing woman.  She had really just started her grown up life. She had many extraordinary talents.  She would sketch and create beautiful images and is known for her stunning jewelry creations. Chelsea graduated from Toni & Guy Hair Academy in 2013. She has been using her creative skills in hairdressing and as a make-up artist.  Chelseaâ€™s heart and loving spirit is cherished by everyone who knows her.  Her grace is shared with all who come into contact with her.  She has stunning beauty inside and out! Chelsea has successfully delivered her baby Wyatt.  She was 3 months pregnant at the time of her accident. This little warrior has made it through her surgeries and a very difficult pregnancy. We are blessed to have him arrive at 38 weeks and healthy! Chelsea is facing a very difficult future for a young 24-year-old woman. Disabled and a new single mom!

"$57,307","Lucia Needs Our Help!
"," of $75,000 Goal","Naples, FL",1,"As most of you know Lucia Marie Torres was born December 8th, 2017, and with those of you who know our familyâ€¦.understand the significance of this being the Feast of the Immaculate Conceptionâ€¦and itâ€™s not a coincidence ðŸ™‚ Only a few days prior to that, did Annie and Victor learn just how serious her hypertropic cardiomyopathy was and that she may have Noonan Syndrome. As it turns out, our little LuLuâ€™s heart condition was in fact quite serious. She spent the first six days of her life in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at the Joe DiMaggio Hospital in Hollywood, FL.  We all had to wait several weeks before finding out the results of her genetic testing. Lucia does have Noonan Syndrome. Lucia may exhibit several serious symptoms with Noonan Syndrome, but presently she has been exhibits the following: 
Â·â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯ pulmonary stenosis 
Â·â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯ hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
Â·â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯â€¯ congenital heart defects   Lucia has a wonderful team of doctors advocating for her, this includes her pediatric cardiology and transplant teams at the Joe DiMaggio Childrenâ€™s Hospital. However, this specialized care does come at an added cost for Annie and Victor, who currently live in Naples which is about a 2 hour drive. With only the best as an option for their Lucia, they continue to travel to and from for hospital visits and will need to continue this pre- and post- transplant.   Please help us raise money for this beautiful family that is so much need of our help. This may be a lifetime struggle where Lucia will need to meet with several doctors for the rest of her life. Doctors that may include: pediatricians, surgeons, dermatologists, cardiologists, orthopedists, endocrinologists, and audiologists.  However,  at this time, the immediate concern is if Annieâ€™s health insurance will cover the cost of the transplant that Lucia so desperately needs. In addition to that, there will be medical expenses with the aspects of care and recovery (including copays, medications, transport, and much more) which areâ€¯ not covered by insurance. For less than a week in the NICU they have received a bill for over $149,000.  For the first year after a transplant, a patient remains at high risk for rejection, and there are many costs associated with monitoring and guarding against this, as well as with recuperation in other ways.â€¯ No parent should have to worry about the financial stress while dealing with this. My hope is that we can take some of the financial burden off of  their family so they can focus solely on taking care of their precious baby girl.  Annie has been out on maternity leave and Victor was laid off from his job right before Christmas. They need our help more than ever.  Thatâ€™s where we can help! Iâ€™m setting up this fundraising campaign to help make a difference! Please give what you can and spread the word.â€¯ All donations will help the Torres family.â€¯ If you have questions about this process or about the campaign, feel free to email me using the contact link on the campaign page.  Our whole family thanks you for your continued LOVE and SUPPORT! Whether its a monetary contribution, one of prayerâ€¦or bothâ€¦THANK YOU! ***If you are interested in wearing a bracelet to support Lucia please contact Liz Vargas or copy and paste the link below:
