# Medical Crowdfunding Analysis
**Project Status: In Progress**

Crowdfunding websites are an increasingly common tool for raising money to cover medical expenses. In this project, I aim to scrape data from crowdfunding sites such as

* <a href=https://fundrazr.com>Fundrazr</a>
* <a href=https://www.gofundme.com>Go Fund Me</a>
* <a href=https://helphopelive.org>Helphopelive</a>
* <a href=https://fundly.com>Fundly</a>

After completion of the data scraping, I'll perform exploratory analysis of the text and numeric features to look for interesting patterns. The project could take the following routes:

* prediction model for the amount of money raised
* discovery of the story writing patterns for successful campaigns
* world map visualization of monetary contributions
* deep learning model that generates a story tailored to the campaign
